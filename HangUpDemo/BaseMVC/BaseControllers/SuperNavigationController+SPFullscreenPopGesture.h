/// to-pop behavior in iOS 7+ by supporting fullscreen pan gesture. Instead of
/// screen edge, you can now swipe from any place on the screen and the onboard
/// interactive pop transition works seamlessly.
///
/// Adding the implementation file of this category to your target will
/// automatically patch UINavigationController with this feature.

/// rather than a global way, checking "sp_prefersNavigationBarHidden" property.
